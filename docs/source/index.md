<hr>

torchsynth is based upon traditional modular synthesis written in
pytorch. It is GPU-optional and differentiable.

Most synthesizers are fast in terms of latency. torchsynth is fast
in terms of throughput. It synthesizes audio 16200x faster than
realtime (714MHz) on a single GPU. This is of particular interest
to audio ML researchers seeking large training corpora.

Additionally, all synthesized audio is returned with the underlying
latent parameters used for generating the corresponding audio. This
is useful for multi-modal training regimes.

1024 4-second sounds rendered from the {class}`~torchsynth.synth.Voice`
synthesizer, or listen to the following SoundCloud embed:
